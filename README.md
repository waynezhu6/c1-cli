# c1-cli

Hello! This project is my submission for the technical assessment of Capital One's 2021 Software Engineer internship.  

![what it looks like](https://github.com/waynezhu6/c1-cli/blob/master/c1-cli.png)

It's a CLI written in Node.js, which I picked because of my familiarity with the Javascript language, and because of a wide selection of npm modules that made my life easier when trying to give it some visual highlights. And I figured I might as well make it a CLI since it seems most practical for this application if we were to use it in real life.

The entrypoint for this app is 'c1-cli.js'. And in case you don't have Node.js on your machine, I've included the executables 'c1-cli-[your platform]' that have Node packaged inside alongside my program.
