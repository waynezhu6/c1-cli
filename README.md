# c1-cli

Hello! This little project is my submission for the technical assessment of Capital One's 2021 Software Engineer internship.  



It's a CLI written in Node.js, which I picked because of my familiarity with the Javascript language, and because of a  
wide selection of npm modules that made my life easier when trying to give it some visual highlights. And I figured I might as well
make it a CLI since it seems most practical for this application if we were to use it in real life.

The entrypoint for this app is 'c1-cli.js'. And in case you don't have Node.js on your machine, I've included executables that have 
Node packaged inside alongside my program at the file(s) c1-cli-[your platform].
